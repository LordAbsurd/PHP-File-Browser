Unnamed Simple File Browser
============

Unnamed Simple File Browser (what an incredible name, isn't it?) is a file browser written in PHP, JavaScript and CSS. It displays the list of files and folders in a folder.

* Sorting by name, size and editing time
* Able to move in folders
* Thumbnails for images.
* Admin panel with file uploading
* Responsive interface (Bootstrap, yeah)

The main problem is the quality of the code. I know it's very bad to mixing logic and interface,  VanillaJS and JQuery.
I will try to correct quality code with future commits.

Installation
------------
1. Clone this repo to web site folder
2. Execute init.sql from sql folder
3. Edit config.php with your MySQL database settings
4. Edit default files folder in admin (example.com/admin/)
5. That's it!

Unnamed Simple File Browser is still in beta, so there may be some errors.
